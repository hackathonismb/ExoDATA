# Integration of externally computed DATA for visualization on structure and data analysis in a structural context 
Residue (and atom) level properties are calculated by numerous programs.  The goal is to be able to load in externally computed properties, but also experimental properties for visualization on structure, presentation and sharing, and for analysis, i.e. to compare, combine and correlate multiple properties computed by multiple programs, and open the door to deep and rich structure-properties analysis at various levels of detail.

Testing that I can write more to follow
